#Automated Trash Barrel with Garbage Level Monitoring


(Developed during COVID Pandemic)

Introduction: A simple system called Automated Trash Barrel with garbage level monitoring system, which consist of sensor technology and other more.
The lid of the Smart bin will automatically open itself upon detection of human hand. Smart bin constantly checks current garbage level and will notify the user once it’s full.

Aim: In this project, we will be designing a simple system called the Automated Trash Barrel with Garbage Level Monitoring System, where the lid of the dustbin will automatically open itself upon detection of a human hand and will notify the user once it’s full. The idea is very simple and is driven by the fact that the dustbin requires very frequent cleaning, which is not always possible. In our city, many times we see that the garbage bins or dustbins placed in public places are overflowing. It creates unhygienic conditions for people. It in turn leads to various hazards such as bad odour and ugliness in that place, which may be the root cause for the spread of various diseases. To avoid this hazardous scenario and maintain public cleanliness and health, this work is mounted on a smart garbage system. The main aim is to accommodate more and get the trash can cleaned more frequently using the alert service.

Purpose: The main purpose is that, nowadays, certain actions are taken to improve the level of cleanliness in the country. People are getting more active in doing all the things possible to clean their surroundings. Various movements are also being started by the government to increase cleanliness. We will try to build a system that will notify the corporations to empty the bin on time. In this system, we will put a sensor on top of the garbage bin, which will detect the total level of garbage inside it according to the total size of the bin. When the garbage reaches the maximum level, a notification will be sent to the corporation's office, and then the employees can take further action to empty the bin. This system will help clean the city in a better way. By using this system, people do not have to check all the systems manually, but they will get a notification when the bin gets filled. The idea struck us when we observed that the people always needed to use their hands for opening or flipping the trashcan’s lid. In today’s date, COVID-19 has emphasised the importance of hygiene & cleanliness. Touching the trashcan’s surface with bear hands can get infectious viruses picked on your hands. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose, or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you. As a precautionary measure, it’s better not to touch the trashcans, but we cannot dispose of waste openly in public places! Well, a better solution for this is to have someone open up the trash bins for you! The best solution would be to have a trash bin open itself for you to feed it with waste! Also, the idea is very simple and is driven by the fact that the dustbin requires very frequent cleaning, which is not always possible. In our city, many times we see that the garbage bins or dustbins placed in public places are overflowing. It creates unhygienic conditions for people. It in turn leads to various hazards such as bad odour and ugliness in that place, which may be the root cause for the spread of various diseases. To avoid this hazardous scenario and maintain public cleanliness and health, this work is mounted on a smart garbage system. The main aim is to accommodate more and get the trash can cleaned more frequently using the alert service.
